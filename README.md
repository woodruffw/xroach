xroach
======

A maintained copy of `xroach`.

Key changes:

* Uses a POSIX Makefile, rather than `pmake`
* Refactored to resemble C99

Other than the above, nothing has changed. I don't intend to add or remove functionality.

## Building

`xroach` should build on any platform that supports X11r4 or later.

```bash
$ make
```

## Installation

Copy `xroach` and `xroach.6` to your preferred binary and manpage directories.

## Usage

Refer to `xroach -h` and `xroach.6`.

## Licensing
